> The Cave of Altamira ( AL-tə-MEER-ə; Spanish: Cueva de Altamira [ˈkweβa ðe altaˈmiɾa]) 
> is a cave complex, located near the historic town of Santillana del Mar in Cantabria, Spain. 
> 
> It is renowned for prehistoric cave art featuring charcoal drawings 
> and polychrome paintings of contemporary local fauna and human hands. 
> The earliest paintings were applied during the Upper Paleolithic, around 36,000 years ago. 
> The site was discovered in 1868 by Modesto Cubillas 
> and subsequently studied by Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola.
>
> Aside from the striking quality of its polychromatic art, 
> Altamira's fame stems from the fact that its paintings were the first European cave paintings 
> for which a prehistoric origin was suggested and promoted. 
> Sautuola published his research with the support of Juan de Vilanova y Piera in 1880, 
> to initial public acclaim.
>
> However, the publication of Sanz de Sautuola's research 
> quickly led to a bitter public controversy among experts, 
> some of whom rejected the prehistoric origin of the paintings 
> on the grounds that prehistoric human beings lacked sufficient ability for abstract thought. 
> The controversy continued until 1902, 
> by which time reports of similar findings of prehistoric paintings in the Franco-Cantabrian region 
> had accumulated and the evidence could no longer be rejected.
>
> Altamira is located in the Franco-Cantabrian region 
> and in 1985 was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO 
> as a key location of the Cave of Altamira and Paleolithic Cave Art of Northern Spain.  
> The cave can no longer be visited, for conservation reasons, 
> but there are replicas of a section at the site and elsewhere.
