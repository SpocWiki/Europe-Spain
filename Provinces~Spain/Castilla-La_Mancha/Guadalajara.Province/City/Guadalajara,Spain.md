> Guadalajara ( GWAH-də-lə-HAR-ə, Spanish: [ɡwaðalaˈxaɾa] ) is a city and municipality in Spain, located in the autonomous community of Castilla–La Mancha. It is the capital of the Province of Guadalajara.
>
> Guadalajara lies on the central part of the Iberian Peninsula at roughly 685 meters (2,247 ft) metres above sea level. Most of the city housing is located on the left (southern) bank of the Henares, in between the river and the moors of La Alcarria. In addition to the city, the municipality also includes the villages of Iriépal, Taracena, Usanos, and Valdenoches. As of 1 January 2025, Guadalajara has a registered population of 93,470, which makes it the region's second most populated municipality.
>
> Founded in the 9th century as Madīnat al-Faraŷ under the Emirate of Córdoba, it became a stronghold of the Masmuda Berber clan of the Banū Sālim. After Christian conquest in 1085 from the Taifa of Toledo, it grew into becoming a sizeable town of the Crown of Castile under control of the Mendoza family. It was a hub for mystical iluminismo in the 16th century in the Kingdom of Toledo. Depopulation and decay of key economy parametres ensued in the 17th century. Growth in the 21st century was caused by its closeness to the functional urban area of Madrid.
