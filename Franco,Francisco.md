## #has_/text_of_/abstract 

> Francisco Franco Bahamonde (born Francisco Paulino Hermenegildo Teódulo Franco Bahamonde; 
> 4 December 1892 – 20 November 1975) was a Spanish general and dictator 
> who led the Nationalist forces in overthrowing the Second Spanish Republic during the Spanish Civil War 
> and thereafter ruled over Spain from 1939 to 1975, assuming the title Caudillo. 
> This period in Spanish history, from the Nationalist victory to Franco's death, 
> is commonly known as Francoist Spain or as the Francoist dictatorship.
>
> Born in Ferrol, Galicia, into an upper-class military family, 
> Franco served in the Spanish Army as a cadet in the Toledo Infantry Academy from 1907 to 1910. 
> While serving in Morocco, he rose through the ranks to become a brigadier general in 1926 at age 33. 
> Two years later, Franco became the director of the General Military Academy in Zaragoza. 
> As a conservative and monarchist, Franco regretted the abolition of the monarchy 
> and the establishment of the Second Republic in 1931, 
> and was devastated by the closing of his academy; 
> nevertheless, he continued his service in the Republican Army. 
> 
> His career was boosted after the right-wing CEDA and PRR won the 1933 election, 
> empowering him to lead the suppression of the 1934 uprising in Asturias. 
> Franco was briefly elevated to Chief of Army Staff 
> before the 1936 election moved the leftist Popular Front into power, relegating him to the Canary Islands.
>
> Initially reluctant, he joined the July 1936 military coup, 
> which, after failing to take Spain, sparked the Spanish Civil War. 
> 
> During the war, he commanded Spain's African colonial army 
> and later, following the deaths of much of the rebel leadership, became his faction's only leader, 
> being appointed generalissimo and head of state in 1936. 
> In the course of the war, he used the fascist ideology of Falangism in construction of his regime 
> and became recognized as a fascist leader while receiving support from Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany. 
> He consolidated all Nationalist groups into the FET y de las JONS, thus creating a one-party state, 
> and developed a cult of personality around his rule by founding the Movimiento Nacional. 
> 
> Three years later the Nationalists declared victory, 
> which extended Franco's rule over Spain through a period of repression of political opponents. 
> His government's use of forced labour, concentration camps and executions after the war 
> led to between 30,000 and at least 200,000 deaths. 
> Combined with wartime killings, 
> this brings the death toll of the White Terror to between 100,000 and 350,000 or more. 
> During World War II, he maintained Spanish neutrality, but supported the Axis—
> in recompense to Italy and Germany for their support during the Civil War—
> damaging the country's international reputation in various ways.
>
> During the start of the Cold War, Franco lifted Spain out of its mid-20th century economic depression 
> through technocratic and economically liberal policies, 
> presiding over a period of accelerated growth known as the "Spanish miracle". 
> 
> At the same time, 
> his regime transitioned from a totalitarian state to an authoritarian one with limited pluralism. 
> He became a leader in the anti-communist movement, garnering support from the West, 
> particularly the United States. 
> 
> As the government relaxed its hard-line policies, Luis Carrero Blanco became Franco's éminence grise, 
> whose role expanded after Franco began struggling with Parkinson's disease in the 1960s. 
> In 1973, Franco resigned as prime minister—separated from the office of head of state since 1967—
> due to his advanced age and illness. 
> Nevertheless, he remained in power as the head of state and as commander-in-chief. 
> Franco died in 1975, aged 82, and was entombed in the Valle de los Caídos. 
> He restored the monarchy in his final years, being succeeded by Juan Carlos, King of Spain, 
> who led the Spanish transition to democracy.
>
> The legacy of Franco in Spanish history remains controversial, 
> as the nature of his rule changed over time. 
> His reign was marked by both brutal repression, with tens of thousands killed, 
> and economic prosperity, which greatly improved the quality of life in Spain. 
> 
> His style proved adaptable enough to allow social and economic reform, 
> but still centred on highly centralised government, authoritarianism, nationalism, 
> national Catholicism, anti-freemasonry and anti-communism. 
> 
> The contemporaries regarded Franco as a fascist dictator; among scholars, 
> there has been a long-lasting debate whether it is adequate to define Franco's regime as fascist. 
> It has been described in broad definitions, 
> from a traditional military dictatorship to a fascistized yet not fascist or a fully fascist regime.
