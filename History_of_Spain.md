> The history of Spain dates to contact between the 
> pre-Roman peoples of the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula 
> with the Greeks and Phoenicians. 
> 
> During Classical Antiquity, the peninsula was the site of multiple successive 
> colonizations of Greeks, Carthaginians, and Romans. 
> Native peoples of the peninsula, such as the Tartessos, 
> intermingled with the colonizers to create a uniquely Iberian culture. 
> The Romans referred to the entire peninsula as Hispania, from which the name "Spain" originates. 
> 
> As was the rest of the Western Roman Empire, 
> Spain was subject to numerous invasions of Germanic tribes during the 4th and 5th centuries AD, 
> resulting in the end of Roman rule and the establishment of Germanic kingdoms, 
> marking the beginning of the Middle Ages in Spain.
>
> Germanic control lasted until the Umayyad conquest of Hispania began in 711. 
> The region became known as Al-Andalus, and except for the small Kingdom of Asturias, 
> the region remained under the control of Muslim-led states for much of the Early Middle Ages, 
> a period known as the Islamic Golden Age. 
> 
> By the time of the High Middle Ages, 
> Christians from the north gradually expanded their control over Iberia, 
> a period known as the Reconquista. 
> 
> As they expanded southward, a number of Christian kingdoms were formed, including 
> - the Kingdom of Navarre, 
> - the Kingdom of León, 
> - the Kingdom of Castile, and 
> - the Kingdom of Aragon. 
> 
> They eventually consolidated into two roughly equivalent polities, 
> - the Crown of Castile and 
> - the Crown of Aragon. 
> The early modern period is generally dated from the union of the Crowns of Castile and Aragon 
> by royal marriage in 1469.
>
> The joint rule of Isabella I and Ferdinand II 
> is historiographically considered the foundation of a unified Spain. 
> 
> The conquest of Granada, and the first voyage of Columbus, both in 1492, 
> made that year a critical inflection point in Spanish history. 
> 
> The voyages of the explorers and conquistadors of Spain during the subsequent decades 
> helped establish a Spanish colonial empire which was among the largest ever. 
> 
> King Charles I established the Spanish Habsburg dynasty. 
> Under his son Philip II the Spanish Golden Age flourished, 
> the Spanish Empire reached its territorial and economic peak, 
> and his palace at El Escorial became the center of artistic flourishing. 
> 
> However, Philip's rule also saw the destruction of the Spanish Armada, 
> a number of state bankruptcies and the independence of the Northern Netherlands, 
> which marked the beginning of the slow decline of Spanish influence in Europe. 
> 
> Spain's power was further tested by its participation in the Eighty Years' War, 
> whereby it tried and failed to recapture the newly independent Dutch Republic, 
> and the Thirty Years' War, which resulted in continued decline of Habsburg power 
> in favor of the French Bourbon dynasty. 
> 
> Matters came to a head with the death of the last Habsburg ruler Charles II of Spain; 
> the War of the Spanish Succession broke out between two European alliances 
> led by the French Bourbons and the Austrian Habsburgs, for the control of the Spanish throne. 
> 
> The Bourbons prevailed, resulting in the ascension of Philip V of Spain, 
> who took Spain into various wars and eventually recaptured the territories in southern Italy 
> that had been lost in the War of the Spanish Succession. 
> 
> Spain's late entry into the Seven Years' War 
> was the result of fear of the growing successes of the British at the expense of the French, 
> but Spanish forces suffered major defeats. 
> Motivated by this and earlier setbacks during Bourbon rule, 
> Spanish institutions underwent a period of reform, especially under Charles III, 
> that culminated in Spain's largely successful involvement in the American War of Independence. 
>
> During the Napoleonic era, Spain became a French puppet state. 
> Concurrent with, and following, the Napoleonic period 
> the Spanish American wars of independence 
> resulted in the loss of most of Spain's territory in the Americas in the 1820s. 
> 
> During the re-establishment of the Bourbon rule in Spain, 
> constitutional monarchy was introduced in 1813. 
> 
> Spain's history during the nineteenth century was tumultuous, 
> and featured alternating periods of republican-liberal and monarchical rule. 
> 
> The Spanish–American War led to losses of Spanish colonial possessions 
> and a series of military dictatorships, during which King Alfonso XIII was deposed 
> and a new Republican government was formed. 
> 
> Ultimately, the political disorder within Spain led to a coup by the military 
> which led to the Spanish Civil War. 
> 
> After much foreign intervention on both sides, the Nationalists emerged victorious; 
> Francisco Franco led a fascist dictatorship for almost four decades. 
> 
> Franco's death ushered in a return of the monarchy under King Juan Carlos I, 
> which saw a liberalization of Spanish society 
> and a re-engagement with the international community. 
> 
> A new liberal Constitution was established in 1978. 
> Spain entered the European Economic Community in 1986 
> (transformed into the European Union in 1992), and the Eurozone in 1998. 
> Juan Carlos abdicated in 2014, and was succeeded by his son Felipe VI.
